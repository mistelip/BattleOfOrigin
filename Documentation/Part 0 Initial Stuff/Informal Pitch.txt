#1:
In the 16th century religion has strongly hindered the evolution of mankind. Some men wanted to stay true to the bible while others wanted to advance further in science. Both parties believed to be correct and never stopped trying to convince the other party of having incorrect world views.

 
 
- First meeting
    - Everything that came to mind for "evolution"
    - Highly abstract game ideas
    - Total of 9 Abstract Ideas
    
    
#2:There has always been a fight going on where exactly we come from and how we got to be the way we are today. While most religions teach us that humanity was created the way we are now Darwinists believe to have evolved over time.

------------------------------------------
Our game settles this disagreement. You can choose your team being either religious or scientific. The aim is to convert the other team until the whole world shares your opinion.

We took a standard shooter in a team death match scenario.
Instead of killing each other like some people in the real world do, the players are able to temporarily freeze others to disable their movements. Scientists do this using their stun gun while religious people can insult and curse the other team. Resulting the scientist to stop and think about his actions.

The main aim of the game as said is to convert all players of the other team. This is done by using a big-wonder. A big-Wonder can be generated by forming a group of players of the same team and praying or studying. A progress bar for both teams is visible to see how far along they are with their wonder. While the people are studying/praying they cannot attack and of course are very vulnerable to being attacked by the other team.

Once a big wonder is completed it can be used. This results in a cone of god-rays or rain of books. Every player who is hit by this will be converted to this team.
