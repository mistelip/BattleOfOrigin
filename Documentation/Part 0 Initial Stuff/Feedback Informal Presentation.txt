someone thinks 1 screen would be better (easier and better overview)

first/third person perspective?

players behaving cartooney (is funny and simple, make topic less contraversial)

use swarm simulation for AI

do we really want to stay with the same team all the time or allow friendly fire? Could be funny aspect too...
